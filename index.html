                              <p>UNHCR has standardized its approach to creating and releasing public information products in the first month, during L2 and L3 emergencies. This guidance pertains to this new suite of products, called CORE. Guidance about other IM-related activities can be found in the IM emergency guide. </p>
                        </div>
                        <hr>

                    <section id="core" class="my-5">
                        <h2>CORE</h2>
                        <p>CORE is UNHCR’s solution for establishing recognizable, branded, predictable and consistent information products in the early days of an emergency response. 
                            The goal is to establish UNHCR’s leadership and coordination role in refugee emergencies by releasing quality products. The guiding philosophy of CORE is to empower UNHCR operations to make the best use of information available, to consistently create external products. </p>
                        <p>CORE is not the only responsibility of IM teams in emergencies. There are other tools, services and activities that must be established as part of an emergency response. 
                            This document provides guidelines for facilitating the creation of CORE information products.</p>
                        <h4>Timeline of CORE products</h4>
                        <div class="card p-4 border-0 my-4">
                            <img src="assets/img/TTIM_IM_products_final.svg" class="card-img-top" alt="...">
                        </div> 
                            <p>CORE is about making the best use of the best available data. This implies:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Releasing products from week 1 of the emergency based on information available. </li>
                            <li>Establishing a system for compiling or collecting timely, accurate, AGD figures on population movements.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Detailed product definitions for the CORE products are available at this <a href="https://unhcr365.sharepoint.com/:x:/t/GDS-TTIMTEG/EZQULzzMU7hAqnUv96r2chkBH5iKcdkE5wT7XnQ4MNMiQQ?e=6cse0d&wdLOR=cE97CC334-E269-274E-A4E2-FBE14CECFDED">link</a>.  It will explain the essential and optional data points expected in each product. The scheduling and content of CORE products should follow the product definition as much as is feasible.</p>
                        <p>By definition, CORE products are external, i.e., to be released externally and targeted to external audiences. UNHCR must establish itself as a trusted source of information for governments, our partners, donors, the general public, and all other relevant audiences and stakeholders. UNHCR must be confident releasing products with imperfect data when it is the best-available information. The early days of an emergency are, by definition, chaotic environments. Perfect data is not possible in the very early days of a response, and we must not let perfection be the enemy of the good.</p>
                        <p>Ensuring timely clearance of CORE products is also key. This guide includes advice on establishing <a href="https://unhcr365.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/msteams_8fbc53_097225/EWWSBL-agVBFmoMzs1cusk0BCxS_ITdTKPpInO48Ik25ow?e=fjYWOT&wdLOR=cCFFC85B3-D9E3-7344-A0BD-4E46414441BA">CORE external clearance protocols</a>. Clearing products is not the responsibility of IMOs. Senior managers should be aware of their responsibility to quickly clear CORE products. Nevertheless, a good preparedness action is to discuss with management who and how CORE products will be cleared.</p>
                        <p><strong>Reminder</strong> : Data responsibility in humanitarian action is the safe, ethical and effective management of personal and non-personal data for operational response. It is a critical issue for the humanitarian system to address and the stakes are high. Ensuring we ‘do no harm’ while maximizing the benefits of data requires collective action that extends across all levels of the humanitarian system. Humanitarians must be careful when handling data to avoid placing already vulnerable individuals and communities at further risk. This is especially important in contexts where the urgency of humanitarian needs drives pressure for fast, sometimes untested, data solutions, and the politicization of data can have more extreme consequences for people. For more information on how Humanitarian agencies, including UNHCR, can ensure concrete steps for data responsibility, please review the <a href="https://interagencystandingcommittee.org/operational-response/iasc-operational-guidance-data-responsibility-humanitarian-action">IASC Operational Guidance on Data Responsibility in Humanitarian Action</a>.</p>

                        <h2 >Preparedness</h2>
                        <p>Preparedness is key to ensuring the operation’s ability to deliver CORE products.  It is expected that CORE will be implemented in all new L2 and L3 emergencies. Therefore, an L1 declaration is a trigger to lay the groundwork for implementing CORE.</p>
                        <p>As a first step, IMOs should become involved in the contingency planning process and be familiar with the sections and activities that require IM support, data, and products. At this link is an <a href="https://unhcr365.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/msteams_8fbc53_097225/EYDVntU10QFPr7Cb2v86RsIBvu6CSQGdKvnwz5r2xbCEvg?e=ZMRavw&wdLOR=c8CE803B2-C0BE-BB4B-A149-98A4F2F83145">annotated version of the DESS template for contingency plans</a>. It contains suggestions about how IMOs can be involved in supporting the contingency planning process. </p>
                        <p>The preparedness phase is also when IMOs should become familiar with the CORE guidance as well as related guidance for Flow Monitoring (link tbc), <a href="https://unhcr365.sharepoint.com/teams/DIP-PMT">Emergency Protection Monitoring</a>, and other useful resources. IMOs should already compile Common operational datasets (CODs) if not already done. This is also the time to strengthen coordination with other IM actors such as the Government, OCHA, other UN agencies, and local and international NGOs.</p>
                        <p>In the preparedness phase, Information Management is an enabling activity. As defined by the <a href="https://unhcr365.sharepoint.com/sites/preparedness">DESS Preparedness Guidance</a>:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Data preparedness: Ensure that pre-crisis data is available, along with the list of existing data capacity (i.e., staff and materials), data sources, data activities and their owners, and CODs for the country of asylum and country of origin (or areas of origin and displacement in the case of internal displacement). Identify, compile and make ready emergency IM guidance, tools and products, such as for <a href="https://im.unhcr.org/na/">Needs Assessments</a>, Flow Monitoring (and other types of population data management), and <a href="https://unhcr365.sharepoint.com/teams/DIP-PMT">Protection Monitoring</a> in Emergencies.</li>
                            <li>IM Coordination: Strengthen the ability of response actors to develop and implement a coordinated IM response in an emergency.  This could involve conducting capacity building for local and international actors, assessing data-related resource needs for different emergency scenarios, establishing contacts with relevant government authorities, and establishing or strengthening an IMWG. The IMWG can make early preparations related to data and information sharing, establish common typologies, and agree on common tools and services (e.g., Operational Data Portal (ODP), 3/4/5Ws, joint assessments, etc.).</li>

                        <p>Use the available CORE template(s) to generate the product. This link will allow you to download the CORE product template. It is available in both Adobe Illustrator, Microsoft Excel, PowerBI, and PowerPoint formats. This one template can be used for all CORE products.  It consists of a blank A4 page (portrait or landscape) with the CORE logo, headers, and footers. To this ‘blank canvas’ you can select the relevant ‘modules’ for your product. There are many key figures to choose from, as well as chart templates and other useful graphic design elements. Please remember to consult the <a href="https://unhcr365.sharepoint.com/:x:/t/GDS-TTIMTEG/EZQULzzMU7hAqnUv96r2chkBH5iKcdkE5wT7XnQ4MNMiQQ?e=WOi7k8&wdLOR=c7A883465-42F4-4043-8D00-5ECA2F5444A9">CORE product definition</a>. Your CORE products should contain all relevant “Essential” data points. While every context is different and CORE products should reflect your context, the idea is for CORE to be relatively consistent and predictable across all new emergencies. Therefore, following the product definitions and using the templates is expected. </p>

                            <p>This product will likely be based primarily on secondary data and will provide general, high-level information in ‘broad strokes’. Sources of information could include initial reports from the Government, from UN agencies, NGOs, and/or the media. Other sources could include available pre-crisis population statistics and data. You should also liaise with the Senior Emergency Coordinator and get a short narrative on the situation, movement, conflict situation and response. The week 1 product should also contain some information on border crossings and other important locations. </p>
                            <p>To gather information regarding border crossing points, UNHCR office presence, camps and settlement available in the country, the following actions can be taken:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Liaise with the HQ Mapping Unit in the Global Data Service through <a class="text-primary">hqmap@unhcr.org</a> to request UNHCR office locations.</li>
                                <li>Liaise with the government focal point through the Senior Emergency Coordinator to obtain the list of all entry points (opened and closed) and settlements (if already available).</li>
                                <li>Consult local NGOs or Community-Based Organization (CBOs) already in country about the list of entry points and settlement.</li>
                                <li>If required, request satellite images along borders to identify crossing points by contacting <a class="text-primary">hqmap@unhcr.org</a> with the specified range of dates of image acquisition, as well the name of the city/village and district/region/country (if possible, coordinates), the size radius of the image in km2. Note that getting recent images can take time and may come with a cost (this requires budget codes before the request is processed).</li>
                                <li>Consult your Regional Bureau if the information above is not available or for additional support. </li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>    
                        <p>It is possible, though uncommon, that the location of refugees, border crossings, and/or UNHCR offices is sensitive and should not be visualized. If there is any doubt, please consult knowledgeable Protection staff.</p>
                        <p>Estimating the number of people displaced is important for the Initial Population Data product. Equally important is implementing a means of collecting increasingly accurate data on the number of people moving and their characteristics. Guidance on population flow monitoring is being prepared by the GDS; a draft version for field testing is expected in the first quarter of 2023.  The <a href="https://unhcr365.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/eo-gdssds-903-Flowmonitoring/EYDnw8brxdVDvSxqjowKEKUBv-VNsRyB41DmN8tARdgOug?e=fhTsID&wdLOR=c42AF96BE-BC02-9548-85DF-2A2AF19CED62">working version of the guidance</a> is available although subject to change in the interim. </p>
                        <p>In summary, where possible, multiple methodologies should be implemented and the results triangulated. The methodologies that can be employed vary widely depending on the operational context.  Some important approaches include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Border crossing figures from the Government, Inter-Agency fora or partners.</strong> Liaise with the Senior Emergency Coordinator to agree on how to contact the government to request the actual or estimated number of inflows from border guards and/or immigration officers stationed at border crossing points (entry and exit).  These figures might also be available through inter-agency coordination fora, and otherwise, specific partners might be able to provide figures that can be compiled.  Where possible this should be organized as part of the operation’s contingency planning prior to the emergency.  Ideally the estimates would include disaggregation by border entry point and AGD characteristics.  It is important the methodology for the estimates be explained and the quality of the estimates assessed.  </li>
                                <li><strong>Pre-screening / Group level registration / Individual Level registration.</strong> In some situations, when funds are available, the operation may deploy staff to some or all entry points for pre-screening and or group/individual registration. In such situations, liaise with the Registration staff or focal point in the operation to obtain the registration figures broken down by entry point and if available by AGD characteristics. Note that if a group level registration is conducted, data on family size, age and gender breakdown, country of origin, specific needs within the group, arrival date and pre-registration date should be available. Click <a href="https://emergency.unhcr.org/entry/52546/emergency-registration-in-refugee-operations#:~:text=Registration%20in%20emergencies%20helps%20to,referred%20to%20appropriate%20protection%20services.">here</a> to see the list of data points in case Individual Emergency Registration is conducted. </li>
                                <li><strong>Border Monitoring.</strong> Border monitoring may or may not already be in place. </li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>In case border monitoring is already in place, engage with the owner/lead of the activity to explore if and how to include population flows in the information gathered, taking into consideration the operational context and associated risks. </li>
                                    <li>In case border monitoring is not in place, explore the appropriateness and feasibility of this with the Senior Emergency Coordinator. If the decision is made to proceed, coordinate closely with sectoral focal points in the design and implementation process.  </li>
                                    <li>Methodology option: Key informant interviews</li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>If not already done, coordinate with the Senior Emergency Coordinator to identify individuals who could serve as Key Informant (KI) from the border entry point or refugees’ settlement (e.g.: government officials at the entry points, community leaders, individuals in the refugee community).</li>
                                        <li>In case key informant interviews are already being conducted, liaise with the owner/lead to explore if/how to, include population movement, flow monitoring and settlement locations – after first jointly assessing if these questions are appropriate for the existing key informants. </li>
                                        <li>In case a key informant methodology is initiated through the work to collect population data, coordinate with other units to ensure that information collected is not only limited to population flows but also include other prioritized information that is appropriate to collect via key informants (generally) and this group of key informants (specifically).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <li>Methodology option: Direct observation at border crossings. Direct observation can be used to rapidly collect different types of information. It does not require costly resources, or detailed training, which makes it a quick data collection process that is easy to implement. Direct observation can be done by the Protection or other colleagues deployed to the border entry points and settlement areas. Liaise with the owner/lead of the activity to discuss if/how population flow at entry points and settlements can be collected through observation methods, and the resources required for this.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <li><strong>Social media / mobile monitoring.</strong>  Identify whether mobile phone coverage and social media usage within the country is adequate to inform estimates of population flows, and whether summaries of this information are available.  Contact the Global Data Service for more information.</li>
                                <li><strong>Media monitoring.</strong>  The UNHCR Global Communication Service (DER) is equipped with the necessary tools to support operations in assessing the authenticity of information on media outlets. If you want to use media information, contact the communication focal point at the Regional Bureau or make a request through DER using this <a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=gXnD5WRmNEGKDGVD0q-AvrkR5Ru0Rs1ImMJRSQzjxYtUOU84SDRTV0hCVzhRQ0tWSUpCSzhSU1g3VyQlQCN0PWcu">link</a>.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <p>Consult the Statistics & Data Analysis colleagues in your Regional Bureau for available resources, templates, and any other support regarding the implementation of the above points.</p>

                            <p>The Week 1 Population data product probably relied mainly on secondary data, and included more general information, narrative, and estimates.  The goal in the Week 2 product is to include more primary data. This includes more accurate numbers, rather than estimates, with more disaggregation, both geographically and demographic. The week 2 product should also start to include trends in daily arrivals, border crossings etc. </p>
                            <p>This is also a chance to improve the geographic information on your map, e.g., to add border crossings points, refugee camps/settlements, areas of origin, etc. Liaise with reliable actors (e.g., the government officials, partners, key informants in the community, protection team) to obtain information about settlements or other location types, along with GIS coordinates.</p>

                        <p>Similar to the approach taken with the Week 1 product, UNHCR should work along two tracks to be able to describe humanitarian needs.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Based on secondary data, lessons learned, and historical experience, information should be provided about the expected needs. Protection and sectoral needs are relatively similar across refugee emergencies. The world looks to UNHCR to advocate for the needs of refugees. A comprehensive needs assessment is not necessary to be able to describe priority needs and advocate for resources. </li>

                                <li>The Week 2 initial needs overview should try to answer the following questions</li>

                                    <li>Who are the most affected people?</li>

                                </ul>
                                <li>Again, it is unlikely that there will be actual needs assessment data available in Week 2. Therefore, information should be gathered from Protection and other relevant colleagues who can articulate the likely needs of those arriving. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>At the same time, work should begin on conducting a rapid needs assessment, to gather data to verify the assumptions we have made above. Guidance is available at this site, but is scheduled to be replaced in the coming year. </li>

                            <p>As stated earlier, you are likely to create additional products other than the population, needs and response products. It is assumed that by Week 4, the emergency response is fully underway, and data is being collected and generated by different actors through different systems and methods. The IM team should consult colleagues on the need for “analytical deep dive” products on one or more prioritized themes and topics, as well as the feasibility and timelines (e.g., resources required, targeted audiences).  As always, when it comes to CORE, the goal is to make the most of the data available. Examples of possible deep-dive analytical products could include a product about cash programming (using data from registration), or about a particular theme that is relevant and for which data is available, e.g. Child Protection, host communities, GBV, Shelter, etc. </p>
                            <p>Any analytical deep dives produced in the first weeks of a response should be branded as CORE, making as much use of the product template as possible. </p>

                        <h2>After Week 4</h2>
                        <p>CORE is about launching a humanitarian response in an emergency situation. These products will support UNHCR’s leadership and coordinating role in the response and establish UNHCR as a trusted and reliable source of information. By the end of the first month, it is expected that the emergency response will be fully established, and CORE products can transition into regular products that one would expect normally. CORE should phase out and be replaced with other public products, e.g., on needs assessments, protection monitoring, registration, 3/4/5Ws, Protection Briefs, Operational Updates, etc.  These ‘regular products’ should no longer be CORE branded, and should instead follow the usual <a href="https://dataviz.unhcr.org">UNHCR data visualization guidelines</a>. </p>
