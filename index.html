                          <hr class="short-hr">
                              <p>UNHCR has standardized its approach to creating and releasing information products in the first month during L2 and L3 emergencies.  
                                This guidance only covers CORE products. Guidance for other IM related activities can be found in the IM emergency guide.</p>
                        </div>
                        <hr>

                    <section id="core" class="my-5">
                        <h2>CORE</h2>
                        <p>CORE is UNHCR’s solution for establishing recognizable, branded, predictable and consistent information products in the early days of an emergency response. The goal is to position UNHCR ‘front and center’ in emergencies through recognized and predictable products and strengthen our role as the coordinator of refugee responses. The guiding philosophy of CORE is to empower UNHCR operations to make the best use of information available to create externally cleared products consistently. </p>
                        <p>CORE is not the only responsibility of IM teams in emergencies. There are other tools, services and activities that must be established as part of an emergency response.  Below are guidelines for facilitating the creation of CORE information products. </p>
                        <p>Detailed product definitions for the CORE products are available at this link.  It will explain the essential and optional data points expected in each product.</p>
                        <p>Releasing CORE products externally is critical. UNHCR must establish itself as a trusted source of information for our partners, donors, and all relevant stakeholders. UNHCR must be confident releasing products with imperfect data when it is the best-available information. The early days of an emergency are by definition, chaotic environments. Perfect data is not possible, and we must not let perfection be the enemy of the good. Ensuring timely clearance of CORE products is also key. Here you can find advice on establishing CORE external clearance protocols (link). Clearing products are not the responsibility of IMOs and senior managers should be aware of their responsibility to quickly clear CORE products. Nevertheless, a good preparedness action is to discuss with management who and how CORE products can be externally cleared. </p>
                        <p>CORE is about making use of the best available data, this implies:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Releasing products from week 1 of the emergency based on information available.</li>
                            <li>Establishing a system for compiling or collecting timely, accurate, AGD figures on population movements.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </section>
                    <hr>
                    <section id="preparedness" class="my-5">
                        <h2 >Preparedness</h2>
                        <p>Preparedness is key for ensuring the operational ability to implement CORE.  It is expected that CORE will be implemented in all new L2 and L3 emergencies. Therefore, an L1 declaration is a trigger to lay the groundwork for implementing CORE. </p>
                        <p>As a first step, IMOs should become involved in the contingency planning process and be familiar with the sections that require IM support, data, and products. At this link is the current DESS template for contingency plans.  At this link is the annoted version? with suggestions on how IMOs can be involved in supporting the contingency planning process. </p>
                        <p>The preparedness phase is also when IMOs should become familiar with the CORE guidance as well as related guidance for Flow Monitoring, Emergency Protection Monitoring, and other useful resources. IMOs should already compile CODs (common operational datasets) if not already done. This is also the time to strengthen coordination with other IM actors such as the Government, OCHA, other UN agencies and NGOs.</p>
                        <p>Information Management enabling actions from the DESS Preparedness Guidance:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Data preparedness: Ensure that pre-crisis data is available, along with the list of existing data capacity (i.e., staff and materials), data sources, data activities and their owners, and CODs for the country of asylum and country of origin (or areas of origin and displacement in the case of internal displacement). Identify, compile and make ready emergency IM guidance, tools and products, such as for Needs Assessments, Flow Monitoring (and other types of population data management), Protection Monitoring in Emergencies, and CORE.</li>
                            <li>IM Coordination: Strengthen the ability of response actors to develop and implement a coordinated IM response in an emergency.  This could involve conducting capacity building for local and international actors, assessing data-related resource needs for different emergency scenarios, establishing contacts with relevant government authorities, and establishing or strengthening an IMWG. The IMWG can make early preparations related to data and information sharing, establish common typologies, and agree on common tools and services (e.g. ODP, 3/4/5Ws, joint assessments, etc.).</li>

                    <section id="week-1" class="my-5">
                        <h2>Week 1</h2>
                        <p>Knowing how many people are moving from where to where is critical for UNHCR and and should be the number 1 priority and the focus of week 1.</p>
                        <p>The product which should be created and disseminated by the end of Week 1 is Initial Population Data.</p>
                        <p>The week 1 initial population data product will likely be based primarily on secondary data and will provide information in ‘broad strokes’. Sources of information could include initial reports from the Government, from NGOs, or the media. Other sources could include available pre-crisis pop data. You should also liaise with the Senior Emergency Coordinator and get a short narrative on the situation, movement, conflict situation and response. The week 1 product should also contain some information on border crossings and other important locations. </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>To gather information regarding border crossing points, UNHCR office presence, and settlement available in the country. </li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Liaise with the HQ Mapping Unit in the Global Data Service through hqmap@unhcr.org to request UNHCR office locations. </li>
                                <li>Liaise with the government focal point through the Senior Emergency Coordinator to have the list of all entry points (opened and closed) and settlement (if already available).</li>
                                <li>Consulting local Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) or Community-Based Organization (CBOs) already in country about the list of entry points and settlement.</li>
                                <li>Requesting satellite images along borders to identify crossing points.  To get satellite images make a request through hqmap@unhcr.org with the specified range of dates of image acquisition, as well the name of the city/village and district/ region/ country (if possible, coordinates) also the size radius of the image in km2. Note that getting recent images can take time and may come with a cost (this requires budget codes before the request is processed).</li>
                                <li>Consulting your Regional Bureau if the information above is not available or for additional support. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>Estimate the affected population.  Guidance on population flow monitoring is being drafted and a draft version for field testing will be released in the first quarter of 2023.  The working version of the guidance is available although subject to change in the interim.  In summary, where possible, multiple methodologies should be implemented and the results triangulated.  The methodologies that can be employed vary widely depending on the operational context.  Some important approaches include:	</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Border crossing figures from the Government, Inter-Agency fora or partners: Liaise with the Senior Emergency Coordinator to agree on how to contact the government to request the actual or estimated number of inflows from border guards and/or immigration officers stationed at border crossing points (entry and exit).  These figures might also be available through inter-agency coordination for a, and otherwise, specific partners might be able to provide figures that can be compiled.  Where possible this should be organized as part of the operation’s contingency planning prior to the emergency.  Ideally the estimates would include disaggregation by border entry point and AGD characteristics.  It is important the methodology for the estimates is provided and the quality of the estimates is assessed.  </li>
                                <li>Pre-screening / Group level registration / Individual Level registration: In some situations, when funds are available, the operation may deploy staff to some or all entry points for pre-screening and or group/individual registration. In such situations, liaise with the Registration staff or focal point in the operation to obtain the population figures broken down by entry point and if available by age and gender. Note that if a group level registration is conducted data on family size, age and gender breakdown, country of origin, specific needs within the group, arrival date and pre-registration date should be available. Click here to see the list of data points in case Individual Emergency Registration is conducted.  </li>
                                <li>Border Monitoring </li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>In case border monitoring is already in place, engage with the owner/lead of the activity to explore if and how to include population flows in the information gathered, taking into consideration the operational context and associated risks. </li>
                                    <li>In case border monitoring is not in place, explore the appropriateness and feasibility of this with the Senior Emergency Coordinator. If the decision is made to proceed, coordinate closely with sectoral focal points in the design and implementation process.  </li>
                                    <li>Key informant-based: </li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>If not already done, coordinate with the Senior Emergency Coordinator to identify individuals who could serve as Key Informant (KI) from the border entry point or refugees’ settlement (e.g.: government officials at the entry points, community leaders, individuals in the refugee community).</li>
                                        <li>In case key informant interviews are already being conducted, liaise with the manager of this process to explore how to, include population movement, flow monitoring and settlement locations – after first jointly assessing if these questions are appropriate for the existing key informants. </li>
                                        <li>In case a key informant methodology is initiated through the work to collect population data, coordinate with other units to ensure that information collected is not only limited to population flows but also include other prioritized information that is appropriate to collect via key informants (generally) and this group of key informants (specifically)</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <li>Direct observation at border crossings: Direct observation can be used to rapidly collect different types of information. It does not require costly resources, or detailed training, which makes it a quick data collection process that is easy to implement. Direct observation can be done by the Protection or other colleagues deployed to the border entry points and settlement areas. Liaise with the owner/lead of the activity to discuss if/how population flow at entry points and settlements can be collected through observation methods, and the resources required for this. </li>
                                </ul>
                                <li>Social media / mobile monitoring: Identify whether mobile phone coverage and social media usage within the country is adequate to inform estimates of population flows, and whether summaries of this information are available.  Contact the Global Data Service for more information.</li>
                                <li>Request of satellite images around entry points and settlements: Contact hqmap@unhcr.org to request satellite images, indicating the specified range of dates of image acquisition, the name of the city/village and district/ region/ country (if possible, coordinates), and the size radius of the image in km². Note that getting recent images can take time and come with a cost. Remember that images regarding the level of damage in the country of origin can help estimate and/or predict displacement. Engage with colleagues in the country of origin before requesting this, as there may be sensitivities (to avoid harm) or the request has already been made (to avoid duplication). </li>
                                <li>Media monitoring: The UNHCR Global Communication Service (DER) is equipped with the necessary tools to support operations in assessing the authenticity of information on media outlets. If you want to use media information, contact the communication focal point at the Regional Bureau or make a request through DER using this link.  </li>
                                <li>Consult the Statistics & Data Analysis colleagues in your Regional Bureau for available resources, templates, and any other support regarding the implementation of the above points.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Use the available CORE template(s) to generate the product. This link will allow you to download the CORE product template. It is available in both Adobe Illustrator, Ms. Excel, PowerBI, and PowerPoint formats. This one template can be used for all CORE products.  It consists of a blank A4 page (portrait or landscape) with the CORE logo, headers, and footers. To this ‘blank canvas’ you can select the relevant ‘modules’ for your product. There are many key figures to choose from, as well as chart templates and other useful graphic design elements. Please remember to consult the CORE product definition (link). Your CORE products should contain all relevant “Essential” data points. While every context is different and CORE products should reflect your context, the idea is for CORE to be relatively consistent and predictable across all new emergencies. Therefore, following the product definition and using the templates is mandatory. </p>

                        <h2 id="week-2">Week 2</h2>
                        <p>The products to be created and disseminated by the end of week 2 are: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Elaborated Population Data.</li>
                            <li>Initial Needs Overview.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>See below guide:</p>
                        <h4>Initial Needs Overview </h4>
                        <p>Needs assessment data aims to identify areas and POC groups most affected, and the priority protection and sectoral risks. </p>
                        <p>Similar to the approach taken with the Week 1 population data product, UNHCR should work along two tracks to be able to say something about humanitarian needs.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Based on secondary data, lessons learned, and historical experience, we should say something about what the needs of refugees are likely to be. Protection and sectoral needs are relatively similar across refugee emergencies. The world looks to UNHCR to advocate for the needs of refugees and a completed needs assessment is not required to be able to say what are the likely needs. For example, women who are displaced are very likely to be at a higher risk for GBV and human trafficking. This is something we can explain in this Week 2 needs overview. </li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The Week 2 initial needs overview should try to answer the following questions:</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Who are the most affected people?</li>
                                    <li>Which sectors require the most urgent assistance?</li>
                                    <li>Where are the largest and most severe needs?</li>
                                    <li>Priority Protection risks</li>
                                </ul>
                                <li>Again, it is unlikely that there will be actual needs assessment data available in Week 2. Therefore, information should be gathered from Protection and other relevant colleagues who can articulate the likely needs of those arriving. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>At the same time, work should begin on conducting a proper rapid needs assessment, to gather data to verify the assumptions we’ve made above. Guidance is available here. Below is a brief summary of what this would entail.  Support the design and implementation of a Joint Rapid Need Assessment in consultation with the Senior Emergency Coordinator, UNHCR staff and partners (as relevant) to help identify the immediate protection and sectoral needs. </li>

                        <h2>Week 3</h2>
                        <p>The products to be created and disseminated by the end of week 3 are: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Elaborated Population Report</li>

                        </ul>
                        <h4>Elaborated Population Overview</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Based on data collected from Systems implemented in week 1 and 2, provide more details regarding population figures by geographical locations and arrival trends. The product should be much more data driven than earlier products. </li>
                            <li>Using the above guide and data gathered to generate the product. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Elaborated Needs Overview </h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Hopefully there will be more data available on humanitarian needs, instead of relying on estimates and expectations. </li>
                            <li>If possible, try to provide more detail in your answers to the questions raised in week 2 (see above)</li>
                            <li>If possible, discuss with key operational colleagues to see:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>What are the risks if needs are not met?</li>
                                <li>What are the risks if conflict is escalating?</li>
                                <li>Needs disaggregated by age, sex and other prioritized diversity characteristics</li>
                                <li>Expected developments in the next 4 weeks.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>Humanitarian Response Overview </h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>In coordination with programme colleagues, implement a data collection system to track the type of delivery, quantity provided to affected population by geographical location and by partner.</li>
                            <li>Consult with the procurement focal point and obtain data on stockpiles and distributed emergency items (e.g.: Shelter kits, NFIs). </li>
                            <li>Continue to liaise with Programme to update your list of partners. In the second week you should be able to know most partners involved in the emergency and start generating a 2Ws (Who is Where) which will be expanded to a 3 to 5Ws in the coming weeks. Click here for 3Ws template. You can also access the 3Ws to 5Ws template in the UNHCR Kobo ODSSS public collection templates. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The goal with this product is to create a simple product to highlight UNHCR’s activities and contribution to the emergency response. Again, the CORE template will help you to design a product.  </p>
                        <h4>Situation Overview </h4>
                        <p>This is a combination of Population movement, needs and response. It is not expected that this will contain “new” information.  It is a chance to consolidate the operational data we have available related to population movements, needs, and UNHCR’s response. This could be a multi-page data-driven report, summarizing the key points about the emergency response.  </p>

                        <h2>Week 4</h2>
                        <p>The products to be created and disseminated by the end of week 4 are: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Analytical Deep Dive </li>

                        <p>See below guide:</p>
                        <h4>In addition to IM System implemented in week 1, 2 and 3</h4>
                        <h4>Analytical deep Dive</h4>
                        <p>As stated earlier, you are likely to create additional products other than those expected by CORE. It is assumed that by week 4, the operation is fully underway, and data is being generated on several different functions. It is hard to guess what specific needs there could be in any specific operation, but the IM team should be considering producing “analytical deep dives” on one or more topics.  As always, when it comes to CORE the idea is to make the most of the data available. Examples of possible deep-dives could include a product about cash programming (using data from registration), or about a particular theme that is relevant and for which data is available, e.g. Child Protection, host communities, GBV, Shelter, etc. </p>

                        <h2>After Week 4</h2>
                        <p>CORE is about launching a humanitarian response. These products will support UNHCR’s leadership and coordinating role in the response and establish UNHCR as a trusted and reliable source of information. By the end of the first month, it is expected that the operation will be fully established, and CORE products can transition into regular products that one would expect in a normal operation. CORE should phase out and be replaced with public products on needs assessments, protection monitoring, registration, 4/5W, Protection briefs, Operational Updates, etc. </p>
